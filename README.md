**connectOS** — The world’s first Φ-adaptive, privacy-first operating environment that turns any phone (even 10+ years old) into a secure, quantum-ready computer. No root, no heavy installs, zero tracking. Built for people who only have a phone, but dream big.

## Why connectOS?
- **Universal Adaptation**: Uses the golden ratio (Φ ≈ 1.618) for harmonic scaling — layouts never break on small screens, low RAM, or future quantum hardware.
- **Pocket-Power**: Runs on Android (Termux), iOS (iSH), even KaiOS. Dual-boot like magic: detects your device and auto-configures.
- **Privacy by Default**: Ephemeral sessions, full-disk encryption, no telemetry. Your data stays yours.
- **Truth-Seeking Core**: Integrates fractal evolution agents (inspired by xAI's Grok) for self-optimizing tasks — from code editing to quantum sims.
- **For Everyone**: If you've ever rage-quit an app because it looked wrong on your phone... this fixes it. Forever.

> Dedicated to anyone building the future with just a phone in their pocket. No PC? No problem. 🖤

## Quick Start (3 Minutes on Any Phone)
